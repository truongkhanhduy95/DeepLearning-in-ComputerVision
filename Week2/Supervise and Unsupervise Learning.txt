 * Supervised learning means we have a data set that includes the target values (the values we wish to predict). We try to learn a function that correctly predict the target values from the other features, which can then be used to make predictions about other examples. Typical examples: classification, regression.

 * Unsupervised learning means we have a dataset but there is no target to be predicted. Rather, we want to learn a model that might have generated that set. Typical examples: clustering, density estimation, noise reduction.
