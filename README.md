# DeepLearning in Computer Vision

## Week 1: Excercise: 

1. Download any color image file with PNG format from Internet (for those who have no idea about PNG file, please see the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics )

2. Write program to do the following works:
	* Load the color image file downloaded in Step 1
	* Display the color image
	* Convert the color image to a gray image, save to a file
	* Reload the file with gray image and display
	* Make sure your saved files can be opened and displayed by other programs, e.g., ImageViewer, Photoshop etc

3. Take a break

4. Write the program to do the following works:
	* Reload the color image file downloaded in Step 1
	* Resize the image to the size of 256 (pixels) x 256 (pixels)
	* Display the image
	* Save to a file
	* Reload the gray image file converted in Step 2
	* Resize the gray image to the  size of 256 (pixels) x 256 (pixels)
	* Display the image
	* Save to a file

5. Write the program to do the following works:
	* Apply Gaussian filter with different kernel sizes and sigma
	* Explain the differences

6. Use the perspective projection equations to explain why, in a picture of a face taken frontally and from a very small distance, the nose appears much larger than the rest of the face. Can this effect be reduced by acting on the focal length?
